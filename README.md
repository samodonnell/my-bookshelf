# My Bookshelf
My Bookshelf is my small pet project built using Node and MongoDB. It allows me to upload a book that I have read to the database, and will display all of my 'books' I have on my 'shelf'.

You can find a live demo of the site [here](https://nameless-beach-52866.herokuapp.com/books).

## Future updates
I plan to add user authentication and individual book lists, as well as tags and filters.
